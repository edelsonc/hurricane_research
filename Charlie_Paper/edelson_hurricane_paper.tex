	\section{Introduction}
	UPDATE BACKGROUND HERE!!!! In this section I will talk about hurricanes and how they're very interesting model systems. Additionally, I'll go on to talk about a little bit of the recent history into modeling them and why people use them.
	
	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the properties of hurricanes in the Atlantic basin using inferential statistics and machine learning techniques.
